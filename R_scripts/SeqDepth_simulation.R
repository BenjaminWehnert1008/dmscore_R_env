# input: prefiltered (by codon library) gatk path, possible NNK mutations path, output_folder, reduction_fraction (steps in % to reduce counts), threshold to count variant as present in dataset
# output: pdf showing the plot
# limitation: takes quite a lot time: depends on number of counts in prefiltered gatk (4 min on M1 MacBook for 340,000 counts in total) -> reduction_fraction only has a low impact -> need to find more efficient random-sampling algorithm
